    <h1>This Is When The Struggle Starts</h1>
    <p>
      So first I thought I could make a website out of showing you guys on how to edit in fortnite.
       but that didn't go very well so I thought to make a website on how I made this website. Ironic isn't it.
     so i got some help from my Dad. he helped me on a few things. so this is the stuff that I learned first of all:
     <ul>
       <li>IT IS SUPER FUN TO MAKE A WEBSITE</li>
       <li>2nd of all i learned so many new fonts, colors and more!</li>
       <li>i learned a little bit if CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</li
     </ul>
    </p>
